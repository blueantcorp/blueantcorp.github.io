        <p>Apple finally released Xcode Beta 2 with an updated version of SwiftUI. The current version has a Form component which appeared on WWDC sessions. Today we are going to build form styled layout with SwiftUI. I want to show you a real-life example of the settings screen built with SwiftUI's new Form component.</p>

        <p class="post-meta">12 Jun 2019</p>
        <p>SwiftUI gives us @State, @Binding, @ObjectBinding, @EnvironmentObject, and @Environment Property Wrappers. So let's try to understand the differences between them and when and why which one we have to use.</p>

        <p>That is WWDC week, and everybody so excited about so many new things we have this year like SwiftUI, Dark Mode, Updateable CoreML models, etc. I will try to cover all the new stuff during the upcoming weeks. Let's start with SwiftUI. SwiftUI is an entirely new approach to building apps for the Apple ecosystem.</p>

        <p>Last week before WWDC and everybody so excited about new features which we will have just in a few days. However, let's keep posts related to WWDC for next week. This week we are going to talk about my favorite design pattern Delegate. Delegate is the most straightforward and powerful pattern.</p>
