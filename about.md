Hi, I’m Emile, and I live in London. Thanks for visiting my site.

I build iOS and Mac apps, mostly as a contractor, and I write about software development.

I have worked in the software and I.T. services industry for more years than I care to remember. In that time I have used many languages on many platforms. **Much has changed, a lot has stayed the same**.

I have been writing here about my experiences learning and developing for iOS since 2010. **I make no claim to be an expert in any of these things even when it might actually be the case**.

I am happy to share what I **do know** and also what I **don’t know** in the hope of **learning** something myself in the process.

## code samples

You can find all of the **example code** from this website in my [CodeExamples](https://github.com/kharrison/CodeExamples) GitHub repository. All code is released using the MIT License.

## about this site

I use [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) to build this site and I’m very happy with it. I tried a number of static site generators and Middleman is among the best in my opinion. I highly recommend it if you like Ruby-based tools for this sort of thing.

I write my articles in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (with some extensions for footnotes and code blocks) and put the site in a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository for change tracking.
